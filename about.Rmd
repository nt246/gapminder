# Data

We're using ggplot to visually explore global trends in public health and economics compiled by the [Gapminder project](https://www.gapminder.org/about/). This project was pioneered by [Hans Rosling](https://www.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling), who is famous for describing the prosperity of nations over time through famines, wars and other historic events with this beautiful data visualization in his [2006 TED Talk: The best stats you've ever seen](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen).

Loading and subsetting the data:
```{r, message = FALSE}

library(dslabs) #install.packages("dslabs")
library(tidyverse)

gap2011 <- gapminder %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  filter(year == 2011)

```
